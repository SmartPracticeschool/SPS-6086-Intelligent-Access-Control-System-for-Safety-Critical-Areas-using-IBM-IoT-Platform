# SPS-6086-Intelligent-Access-Control-System-for-Safety-Critical-Areas-using-IBM-IoT-Platform
The proposed system will be integrated near the entrance of the safety critical area which will detect the person and check whether he is wearing a helmet and shoes. If the person is taking such safety precautions, he is authorized to enter and the door should be opened or else the person is prevented from entering. Voice alert messages are generated to intimate the person about successful and failed authorizations. All the images will be stored in the cloud so that the admin can access the images through web based and mobile based UI. The admin can also grant or revoke authorization of the person to enter the secured area using the designed UI.
